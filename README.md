Data Structures:

Suits are not Ord

Tableau is [[Card]] no [Card]

EODeal:

A bit over complicated

toFoundation

Aces from the Cell (reserve) only can happens at the start of the game. No need to check

recursivelly

The function a bit confusing.



Excellent testing.

Really hard to follow the code if you do not respect the nomenclature.

I assume that Cell is the Reserve and Tableau are the Columns

Try to avoid to add comments to the far right. You don’t know how readebly is in different

screen ‘s resolutions.

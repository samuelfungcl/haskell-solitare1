# Functional Programming - Haskell
# Solitaire 1

## Description
The assignment was to write code for a Haskell implementation of a Solitaire card game, particularly Eight-Off. The assignment provided me experiences of designing list-based and tuple-based data structures in Haskell and algorithms which defined the Eight-Off operations using recursion, mapping functions and comprehensios.
